## Bug Reports
We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/flowsynx/flowsynx/issues) to track bugs, feature requests, and general project discussion.

To report a bug, [open a new issue](https://github.com/flowsynx/flowsynx/issues/new) and include the following details whenever possible:

- A brief summary or background
- Steps to reproduce the issue
  - Be specific and, if possible, include a minimal reproducible example in C#

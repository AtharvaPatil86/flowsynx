# FlowSynx Roadmap

FlowSynx is a versatile, no-code workflow automation platform that enables organizations and developers 
to design, execute, and monitor DAG-based workflows seamlessly. This roadmap outlines our vision, planned
milestones, and areas where contributors can make meaningful impact.

## Vision

FlowSynx aims to be the most flexible, extensible, and reliable workflow automation engine for both 
cloud and on-premise deployments. Our goal is to empower users to automate complex processes with ease, 
leveraging plugins, triggers, and integrations, while providing robust observability and security.

## Strategic Goals

1. **Ease of Use:** Simplify workflow creation with a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface and intuitive visualization.  
2. **Extensibility:** Enable a rich ecosystem of plugins and integrations.  
3. **Reliability:** Ensure robust execution, with advanced error handling, retry policies, and audit logging.  
4. **Security & Compliance:** Support enterprise-grade authentication and authorization, with auditability and governance.  
5. **Scalability:** Operate efficiently in both single-server and distributed cloud environments.
6. **Community Engagement:** Encourage contributions, feedback, and co-creation with the open-source community.

## Architecture & Core Principles

- **DAG-Based Workflows:** Tasks and dependencies represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs for clear execution logic.  
- **Plugin-Based Extensibility:** Modular design allowing community and custom plugins for new tasks.  
- **Hybrid Execution:** Support for on-prem, cloud, and containerized deployments (Docker, Kubernetes).  
- **Audit & Logging:** Comprehensive logs for execution history, performance metrics, and compliance requirements.  
- **Security First:** Role-based access, JWT/OAuth2 authentication, and enterprise-grade audit trails.

## Upcoming Milestones (Next 6–12 Months)

| Milestone | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Plugin Marketplace** | Add a system for discovering, installing, and managing plugins with versioning. | Done |
| **Authentication & Authorization** | Support Keycloak, OAuth2, JWT, and role-based access control. | Done |
| **Workflow Triggers** | Implement time-based, webhook, event-based, database, file, and other external triggers for automated workflow execution. | In Progress |
| **Retry Policies & Error Handling** | Enhance task retry strategies, failure notifications, and human-in-the-loop support. | Done |
| **GUI Enhancements** | Interactive workflow editor with Mermaid.js visualization and improved usability. | In Progress |
| **Cross-Platform Deployment** | Ensure Windows, Linux, and Docker container compatibility. | In Progress |
| **Support Pagination** | Standardize pagination handling across API responses. | In Progress |
| **Support Schema in Workflow** | Implement JSON Schema validation for workflow definitions. | In Progress |
| **`flowpack` Github Actions** | Streamline CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions to automate plugin packaging and publishing to the FlowSynx Plugin Marketplace. | Planned |

## Mid-Term Objectives (12–24 Months)

- AI-assisted workflow generation via natural language input.  
- Advanced analytics and reporting for workflow execution, performance, and audit logs.  
- Extension of plugin SDK to support multiple programming languages (e.g., python, javascript, go, C++, etc.).  
- CLI and SDK improvements for automation and seamless integration.  
- Workflow versioning and rollback support.  

## Long-Term Vision (24+ Months)

- Creating a wide range of plugins for widely used services and platforms, including databases, cloud solutions, and messaging systems, AI/ML algorithms.  
- Enhanced licensing and commercial support options for enterprise plugins.  
- Intelligent workflow recommendations and optimization.  
- Marketplace for community-contributed workflow templates and reusable components.  
- Integration with leading enterprise SaaS platforms (e.g., Azure, AWS, Salesforce).  
- Real-time collaborative workflow editing for teams.  

## Contribution Opportunities

We welcome contributions across all areas of FlowSynx. Examples include:

- Implementing new plugin.  
- Enhancing CLI tools, SDKs, and plugin development experience.  
- Improving logging, monitoring, and observability features.  
- Writing comprehensive unit and integration tests.  
- Enhancing documentation, tutorials, and onboarding guides.  
- Designing UI/UX improvements for the Blazor workflow editor.  
- Suggesting or implementing new workflow templates and automation ideas.

FlowSynx is a **next-generation workflow orchestration platform** that unifies **automation, scalability, and extensibility** in a single, developer-friendly ecosystem.  
It bridges the gap between **low-code simplicity** and **full-code power**, allowing both developers and operations teams to automate complex tasks seamlessly across **on-prem**, **cloud**, and **hybrid** environments.

Whether you‚Äôre streamlining **DevOps**, managing **data pipelines**, or building **enterprise-grade automations**, FlowSynx gives you the control, flexibility, and insight to make it happen.

## What is FlowSynx?

In today‚Äôs fast-moving software landscape, organizations demand **repeatable**, **modular**, and **secure** automation ‚Äî without the lock-in of rigid platforms.

**FlowSynx** redefines orchestration with:
- A **.NET-based micro-kernel engine** built for speed and reliability  
- A **plugin-driven architecture** that evolves with your needs  
- A **JSON-based DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** workflow model that‚Äôs both human-readable and machine-friendly  

FlowSynx turns your processes ‚Äî from data management to API and ML/AI automation ‚Äî into **clear, maintainable, and reusable workflows**.

## How It Works

At its core, FlowSynx executes **DAG-based workflows** where each task represents an atomic operation ‚Äî reading data, transforming it, sending HTTP requests, or interacting with external systems.

### Core Concepts

- **Workflow JSON** ‚Äî Define tasks, dependencies, and parameters in simple JSON  
- **Plugins** ‚Äî Modular building blocks for any functionality (file I/O, APIs, cloud storage, data transformation, ML/AI, etc.)  
- **Execution Engine** ‚Äî Smart orchestration with:
  - Task dependency resolution (topological sorting)
  - Shared execution context and secure state handling
  - Async execution, retries, and timeouts
  - Built-in logging, metrics, and auditing

## Task Lifecycle

Every task flows through a predictable, reliable lifecycle:

1. **Initialization** ‚Äì Validates plugin and parameters  
2. **Dependency Wait** ‚Äì Ensures prerequisite tasks are done  
3. **Execution** ‚Äì Runs the plugin logic (e.g., `ReadAsync`, `WriteAsync`)  
4. **Error Handling** ‚Äì Retries, fallbacks, or workflow failover  
5. **Post-Processing** ‚Äì Logs, stores outputs, and passes results downstream  

## Execution Modes

Choose how you run FlowSynx ‚Äî on your terms:

| Mode | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Standalone** | Lightweight binary for local or embedded use |
| **Dockerized** | Ready for CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes clusters |
| **API Mode** | Trigger workflows via REST APIs |
| **CLI (`flowctl`)** | Command-line power for developers |

## Runtime Context

- Shared Variables  
- Secure Secrets Management  
- Plugin Buffers & Metadata  
- Real-Time State Tracking

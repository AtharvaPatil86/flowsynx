# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The FlowSynx team takes security seriously and prioritizes protecting our users, their data, and the systems they rely on. 
We apply rigorous security practices throughout our software development and release lifecycle.

If you discover a potential security issue or vulnerability in FlowSynx, **please report it privately** to our security 
team by emailing:

ðŸ“§ [**support@flowsynx.io**](mailto:support@flowsynx.io)

Do **not** open a public issue or pull request, as this could expose the vulnerability before it is resolved.

## Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days**.
2. **Investigation**: The FlowSynx team will investigate the issue and work on a fix or mitigation.
3. **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve and release a patch for confirmed vulnerabilities within **30 days** of the report.
4. **Disclosure**: Once a fix is available, we will coordinate public disclosure with you (the reporter) and include a detailed changelog in the relevant release notes.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and your efforts to keep FlowSynx safe for everyone.
